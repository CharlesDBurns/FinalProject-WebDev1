        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>To establish a level of trust with users and fellow campers alike, we Knights of The Round 
            Tent like to tell you a little bit about ourselves and the organization as a whole. As 
            stated on the homepage, our mission is to bring easy access to camping resources and ancient 
            European history and culture with engaging events and fun facts. Our knights are here to 
            share their knowledge with fellow appreciators of the Medieval Ages. But that's not all they 
            do, they are also here to help with all of your camping needs, whether it's finding a park 
            to camp out on or tips to help make your camping trip the best it can be.</p><br>
            <p class="p2">We're here to help your camping experience be pleasurable and just the way you want it to be. 
            Constantly updating, the knights here at Knights of The Round Tent make sure that you always 
            have the latest information on Medieval-themed events, parks around the country and camping 
            rules and tips to keep your experience pleasing. We constantly seek out Medieval events to 
            show to our users as well as non-medieval events for those who rather attend those instead. 
            This site is one of the best sources of camping information, Medieval events and lists of 
            parks, where knights work tirelessly to give you all the information you need for your camping 
            adventure to start out with a stunning victory!</p>
        <h2>Beginnings</h2>
        <img class="saddle" src="images/Saddles.jpg" alt="Saddles">
        <p>It all started when Charles was to organize a camping trip for him and his friends to go on, 
            he was responsible for planning the trip. They wanted a good place with a great view to camp 
            out at and medieval events either on the way or in the area to attend as they were extremely 
            interested in knights and castles. Upon looking for camping spots and medieveal events, Charles 
            found it hard to orchestrate, it was then he asked, &ldquo;why can't there be a site for both 
            camping and medieval events? Why can't there be place where fellow medieval enthusiasts who love 
            the outdoors can find the information their looking for all in one place?&rdquo; Thus the journey 
            of the Knights of The Round Tent began. Charles set out to create just such a website, learning 
            more about the Medieval Period as he gathered historians and his freinds' knowledge on camping, 
            and that's when he founded Knights of The Round Tent.

                <blockquote>&ldquo;I'm proud to have brought such a vast amount of resources in both camping and the Medieval Ages together in 
                    one place. It certainly is helpful for fellow admirers of the charms of the Dark Ages and of course those who also enjoy 
                    the outdoors and nature.&rdquo;</blockquote></li>

                <blockquote>&ldquo;I'm grateful to be a part of this project, granting people knowledge to use on their camping trips, not all of 
                    which they would know, to better their camping experience. Being out in the open air of nature, with its amazing views, 
                    there's really nothing else like it.&rdquo;</blockquote></li>

                    used to live and how they fought. We learn better from the past, whether it's the methods of which the Crusaders maintained 
                    their order or the major downsides of the monarch system of government.&rdquo;</blockquote></li>
