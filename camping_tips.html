            <h1>Camping Tips</h1>
            <p>Often in the Medieval Ages knights and weary travelers alike had to set up camp 
                when they needed to journey for days on end. Although they didn't have the 
                technology and inventions we do now, camping was more or less the same, you 
                still needed to make a fire, you still needed to cook food and put up tents, and 
                you still needed to trade stories around the fire. On this page, we will go 
                through some camping tips that are sure to help your first or next camping trip 
                a better experience that you can cherish.

            <h2>General Camping Tips</h2>
            <img id="camping_img_1" src="images/Camping.jpg" alt="Tents with Night Sky">
            <p>When planning on camping make sure to gear up, it may seem like obvious advice, but 
                some people can either forget or don't think about what they might need while on the 
                actual trip. Depending on how much space you have in your car, how long you plan on 
                camping and if hiking, you really need to watch how much you bring. Knights of the 
                olden days had to travel relatively light if they weren't taking wagons because their 
                armor already took up some of their weight capacity. It's best to bring things you 
                might need for a good night's sleep as sleep is important and you shouldn't go without 
                it, especially in the wilderness. And make sure your tent and sleeping bags are weather 
                ressistant in case of unforeseen weather. Unless you want to try and live off the land (
                it's not recommended without outdoors experience) you need to pack foods that are easy 
                to prepare like granola bars, beef jerky and canned goods as you will be culinarily 
                limited. Plan for water too, hydration is important, either use tap provided by parks 
                or you can boil or use purification tablets to clean your water. It's always safe to 
                also bring flashlights, lanterns and extra batteries for said equipment as well as a 
                multitool as they are always handy out in the wild for their variety of uses. And always, 
                ALWAYS, bring a first aid kit for accidents, you never know what might happen out in the 
                woods.

            <h2>Fire Safety</h2>
            <img id="camping_img_2" src="images/Campfire_1.jpg" alt="Campfire">
            <p>In case you prefer your food hot, you might want to know basics about what you might want 
                to bring to help create a campfire and what you can do to keep yourself safe doing it as 
                well as others. Matches seem like the most basic thing you need but you could also bring 
                a lighter and something to act as kindling, like newspaper, but of course the woods always 
                have free kindling! If you don't wanna fool with a campfire, you could bring charcoal or 
                propane grills, but when done with charcoal/coal make sure you pour water on it and allow 
                it to fully cool and then try and dispose of it in a metal container, this is the best way 
                to prevent a fire. Now back to campfires, be sure to not leave it unattended as one stray 
                ember or spark can cause a forest fire, it's most likely to happen in a dry season like autumn 
                and less likely in a wet one, like spring or summer, depending on where you are. As long as 
                you keep an eye on the fire, it cannot get out of control. In the event of a fire, you'd want 
                to use any water you have to try to extinguish the flames or if it is small emough, try to 
                smother the flames with your foot, dirt also works well with extinguishing flames. As long 
                as fire cannot get oxygen, it will die. The most important thing to do is make sure the fire 
                doesn't get out of hand as it can spread rapidly, the bigger the flame, the more chance you 
                could lose control of it. In the woods, you are basically in a field of kindling lighting a 
                match.

            <p id="tips_p">Here are some extra tips that may have not been covered, ranked from most to least important.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Take your own Toilet Paper! You'll be grateful later</li>
                <li>Plan activities in advance. Know what you're going to do before you go out into the world.</li>
                <li>Check the weather forecast. It'll give you an idea of what to expect during your trip and you can prepare.</li>
                <li>Don't pitch your tent under a tree! Falling limbs could damage your tent and you! The sap and bird waste isn't a plus either.</li>
