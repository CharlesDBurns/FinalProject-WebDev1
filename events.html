                <h3>Jousting- 9/6/2022</h3>
                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>Do you have what it takes to beat the finest knights of the land? In the Renaissance Festival, 
                    jousting is an available activity in which two knights would ride at each other on horseback 
                    and try to knock the other off. Although, this event used to be to the death back in Medieval 
                    Times with sharper lances, it was later changed to not be so. In this reenactment, volunteers 
                    will be given a tutorial in the basics, proper form, help with putting on armor and riding 
                    horseback with lance and shield. This event takes place in South Carolina.

                <h3>Autumn 4k Charity Run- 9/25/2022</h3>
                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>A 4k run to raise money for charities for clothes and food for the homeless, food for the 
                    starving in Africa and for cancer research. Sponsered by numerous companies and organizations 
                    including Knights of The Round Tent, it is a 4k run or roughly 2.49 miles with the goal of 
                    raising money for these noble causes. Best for beginners to train before the day of the run, 
                    if they plan on paritcipating, unless they just want to run with their friends and family. 
                    This pleasant autumn activity lets people see the gorgeous autumn scenery in the countryside 
                    of Georgia.

                <h3>Sparring- 11/5/2022</h3>
                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>Are you a real knight? Test your skills against Medieval recreatiionists who train like knights 
                    back in the age itself. Protected with suits of armor of course, you'll clash swords like the 
                    knights of old in an authentic reenactment with the exception of safety. Volunteers are given 
                    a crash course in the basics of combat back in the Medieval Ages along with help putting on 
                    armor and basic stances with correct forms. This is an experience that few would regret and 
                    many would remember for a long time to come. This event takes place in Colorado.
