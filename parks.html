                    <h3>Location: Fallas, GA.</h3>
                    <h3>Description:</h3>
                    <p>Spacious yet filled with shady trees, Forger Park is one of the most 
                        underrated parks in all of Georgia. It's home to the longest stretches of 
                        flatlands in Georgia, with just enough trees to provide a comfortable 
                        temperature that's just perfect for camping most of the year. A great 
                        place for beginners to camp out and see how they like it and if they 
                        want to up the experience farther from civilization.

                    <img class="park_imgs" src="images/Templar National Park.jpg" alt="Templar National Park">
                    <h3>Location: London, NV</h3>
                    <h3>Description:</h3>
                    <p>Nationally known for it's park center with an abundance of Templar artifacts 
                        from the Medieval Ages. Located on one of Nevada's many mountain ranges, it 
                        features breath-taking views that make hikes all the more worth it. It is 
                        not recommended for beginners to start off with the hikes at this park, 
                        however, it has been done. Besides the the Templar museum in the park center 
                        there are several different hikes available with and without guides as well 
                        as available camping spots for those who enjoy the wilderness.

                    <img class="park_imgs" src="images/Knotmadup Park.jpg" alt="Knotmadup Park">
                    <h3>Location: Reel, MN.</h3>
                    <h3>Description:</h3>
                    <p>As well as being in Reel Minnesota, it has thick forests and wide paths for 
                        all those forest-lovers out there. This park is great for seasoned campers 
                        who want a real outdoors experience as this park has only one building and 
                        few main paths making it ideal for camping out. Definitely not for beginners. 
                        If you're planning on camping here you should definitely bring bug spray.
